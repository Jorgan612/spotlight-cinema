## Abstract
The goal was to build a React app with the [Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/). This app allows users to view movies from the entire collection, by genre, or searched titles. A user can search for a movie by title and their search results will filter in real time. If a user clicks on a movie it will show the user details about it. Users will also be able to add movies to a watchlist that will show up on a seperate `watchlist` page. Additionally, when visiting the site, and on the homepage, a movie trailer will be selected at random for viewing.
